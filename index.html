        <h2>Why Altschool?</h2>
        <p>
            To be honest, since i got to know about the Tech industry, i have been looking for a good
            platform to learn a tech skill, most that i saw were for a few months and i dont believe a Novice 
            like me can do it in 2-3months. <a href="https://twitter.com/AltSchoolAfrica?s=20" target="_blank">Altschool Africa</a> offer a system like our traditional school.
            i believe if you are dedicated to a program for one year, you will be equipped enough to face
            the industry; that was one of the reasons i choose Altschool.
            ohhh!! on the plus side, i was lucky enough to get a scholarship sponsored by
            the Sam Ibijaken Foudation for Engineering graduates. 
            <br>
            I heard about Altschool Africa from <a href="https://twitter.com/hackSultan?s=20" target="_blank">Hack Sultan</a> on Twitter. Many Thanks to him for the tech
            related contents he dishes out daily; also for the daily <em>Techies Assemble</em>lol.
            It motivates me. Thank you Hack.

            <span>Challenges:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Laptop, its really slow and its literally a 'tv'</li>
                <li>Data. At this point MTN is after my life.</li>
                <li>Stress, combining work and school is no easy feat. </li>

            <span>Journey so far</span> honestly when i started this journey, i was a complete
            novice. Zero knowledge of what software Engineering is. By the Way i started this phase of my life 
            in March 2023. Look at me now, this webpage is proof of my growth.
            so yea, i am super proud of myself.
            </p>
            <p class="ultimate">My Ultimate Goal is to leave the <em>Trenches</em>, that way i can hold
                the door for other intending techies.
